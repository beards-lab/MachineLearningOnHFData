# Repository Overview  

This repository is primarily intended for peer review purposes, except for the **3D Volcano Plot** folder, which may be made public in the future.  

## Folder Structure  

1. **Clustering**  
   - Contains scripts and examples demonstrating clustering methods.  
   - Includes data preprocessing, clustering algorithms, and visualization functions for interpreting the results.  

2. **3D Volcano Plot**  
   - Includes tools for creating 3D volcano plots for data visualization.  
   - Provides scripts and functions for generating plots with Umich cohort.  
   - This folder is under development and might be shared publicly at a later stage.  

3. **Prognostic Model**  
   - Features machine learning models such as Random Survival Forest and Lasso Cox Regression.  
   - Includes the entire workflow:  
     - **Training Process**: Training models on internal datasets.  
     - **Validation**: External validation using independent datasets.  
   - Provides scripts for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.  
   - Contains visualization functions for performance metrics, such as survival curves and feature importance plots.
